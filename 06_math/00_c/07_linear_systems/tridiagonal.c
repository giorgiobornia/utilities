	This solves a tridiagonal system of linear equations  m*x=f.

	Input:
	The order of the linear system is given by  n.

	by the arrays  a, b, and c, respectively. more precisely,
		m(i,i-1) = a(i),  i=2,...,n

		m(i,i+1) = c(i),  i=1,...,n-1

	specified above.
	iflag=1 means that the lu factorization of  m  is already known
	and is stored in  a,b, and c. This will have been accomplished
	by a previous call to this subroutine.

	Output:
	Upon exit, the LU factorization of  m  will be stored
	in  a,b, and c.
	The solution vector  x  will be returned in  f.
	ier=0 means the program was completed satisfactorily.
	ier=1 means that a zero pivot element was encountered, and
