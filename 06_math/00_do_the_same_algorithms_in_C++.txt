Do a class NonlinearEquation that contains

- the data of the equation (interval [a,b], initial guess, etc...)
- a function solve() that switches between different methods

  This can be done with a Solver father class, and many children Bisection, Secant, Tangent, etc...


Or, do a class Function with a method    compute_integral() that uses multiple ways
