- Use some C++ features, such as 
    std::vector, 
    declarations in between instructions


- Do a class NonlinearEquation that contains

 - the data of the equation (interval [a,b], initial guess, etc...)
 - a function solve() that switches between different methods

  This can be done with a Solver father class, and many children Bisection, Secant, Tangent, etc...


- Do a class Function with a method    compute_integral() that uses multiple ways
