  /*
      Notes:
 - main(): inizio programma
  It is an example of FUNCTION  (see later when we talk about functions), with return value and optional arguments

  Every executable is generated by a \texttt{main} function
 
  The main function contains the program

 - comment with /* ...


 - "gcc file.c" creates a.out
 - ./a.out to run the program
