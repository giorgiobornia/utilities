This allows inserting certain lines as specified in the 'change.sed' file to files


sed -f change.sed < file_to_be_modified.ipe   > result.tmp

The backslash \ are NEWLINES

If the backslash is a character you have to use the \\ double backslash

If you forgot a backslash...

sed 's/pdfobjcompresslevel0/\\pdfobjcompresslevel0/' < ${file} > ${file}.tmp

Remark: single quotes are important in '/../../'
