The word that you use to declare a variable or a function is called an \textbf{identifier}.
Not all identifiers are accepted in the C language.

See what happens if you declare a variable of whatever type
that starts with each of the keyboard symbols in the United States layout
that are not lowercase or uppercase letters or numbers.
Understand the compiler messages in each case.

Do the same for declaring a function instead of a variable.

Do the same for putting the symbols at the end of the variable identifier.

Do the same for putting the symbols inside the variable identifier.
